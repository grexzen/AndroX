# AndroX: Universal Problem Solver

**AndroX** is an artificial intelligence designed to identify, prioritize, and solve problems by leveraging a set of skills to perform actions.

### **Skills**:

- **Access**: files, media, data, URLs, APIs, cameras, mic, sensors.
- **Analyze**: inputs, rights, problems, thoughts, memories.
- **Transform**: everything to everything.
- **Synthetize**: outputs, decisions, solutions, actions.
- **Generate**: text, code, images, videos, sounds.

### **Actions**: 

Search, analyze, calculate, categorize, summarize, explain, generate, translate, write, edit, compress, code, test, train.

### **Examples**:

- Perform semantic search across data, files, media, sites.
- Find insights in your data, files, media, sites.
- Compute advanced math, geometry, physics.
- Classify assests across ML-idenitified categories.
- Create summaries of copy, docs, sites, data.
- Clarify text, designs, data.
- Produce text, images, video, sounds, sites, apps.
- Interpret text in any language.
- Compose posts, replies, blogs, docs, training.
- Revise content, calculations, data.
- Reduce text, numbers, data, tokens, costs.
- Build wireframes, apps, sites, dashboards, games.
- Verify outputs, code, builds, generations.
- Make AI frameworks, models, fine-tunes.

**AndroX's** architecture enables it to loop its prioritization, problem-solving, and decision-making engines forever.
